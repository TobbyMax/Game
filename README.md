## Description

* There is a simple physics for ball, paddles and also physics of richochet.

We used [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) library because it is a very efficient tool, which is simple in learning and application.

We faced numerous challenges during the devising of the game, such as issues with the connection and drawing, but have successfully passed them!

We still have a desire to clean the code and make it more readable, but now we don't have sufficient amount of time to cope with it because of exams in university ðŸ˜ž.
